# Weisfeiler-Lehman Neural Machine for Link Prediction

This repository provides Python implementation for method proposed in the paper "M. Zhang, Y. Chen, Weisfeiler-Lehman Neural Machine for Link Prediction, KDD 2017".

## Introduction
Weisfeiler-Lehman Neural Machine (WLNM) is a subgraph-based link prediction method leveraging deep learning to automatically learn graph structure features for link prediction from links' enclosing subgraphs.  
The method was proposed in "M. Zhang, Y. Chen, Weisfeiler-Lehman Neural Machine for Link Prediction, KDD 2017".
